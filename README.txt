::::::: Hayy: Museum For Cities :::::::

Project Description
------------------------
Hayy allows people to look at cities in the way they would look at paintings. 
Cities are fine gestures for the lives they encompass. Every building, street and shop, collectively and individually, tell the story of the whole city and the people living in it.
With a reimagined way for how "location" can be viewed, Hayy is trying to view cities not as functions (best price, nearest POI, ...) but as stories, stories about its people.



A New Perspective On "Places"
------------------------
My Application is structured in a way that allows buildings to be a part of a bigger picture, the picture of a "Hayy"
In Arabic, Hayy means both a neighborhood and a life. The idea is that every "Hayy" is a pedestal for the life of its people.
In my database I have carefully made additional fields for "epochs" and "Building Types" that would give users more flexibility in exploring their, and others', cities. 



External Libraraies/APIs used
----------------
com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap;							(MapFragment)					to add maps to places info cards.
com.readystatesoftware.sqliteasset.SQLiteAssetHelper			(db/DbAssetHelper.java)		to handle an already-existing self-containted db in the app's assets
android.support.v7.widget.CardView																					to add CardView to the project (Material Design)

Notes
---------
* I've included the KEY for google maps in this projects, please do not redistribute. 
* The database in this project is a remarkably valuable asset as it's written from the scratch. No similar database exists as it includes all the names and IDs of places inside "Historic Cairo - the world heritage cite" (ie: 500+ places)
* Please find in the project the folder "screenshots" to view some of the final screenshots on the test devices.
